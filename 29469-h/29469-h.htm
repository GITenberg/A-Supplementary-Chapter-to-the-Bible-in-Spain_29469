7</span>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>
<p>In 1845 Richard Ford published his <i>Hand-Book for Travellers
in Spain and Readers at Home</i> [2 Vols. 8vo.], a work which
still commands attention, and the compilation of which is said to
have occupied its author for more than sixteen years.&nbsp; In
conformity with the wish of Ford (who had himself favourably
reviewed <i>The Bible in Spain</i>) Borrow undertook to produce a
study of the <i>Hand-Book</i> for <i>The Quarterly
Review</i>.&nbsp; The following Essay was the result.</p>
<p>But the Essay, brilliant as it is, was not a
&lsquo;Review.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not until page 6 of the suppressed
edition (p. 25 of the present edition) is reached is the
<i>Hand-Book</i> even mentioned, and but little concerning it
appears thereafter.&nbsp; Lockhart, then editing the
<i>Quarterly</i>, proposed to render it more suitable for the
purpose for which it had been intended by himself interpolating a
series of extracts from Ford&rsquo;s volumes.&nbsp; But Borrow
would tolerate no interference with his work, and promptly <!--
page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>withdrew the Essay, which had meanwhile been set up in
type.&nbsp; The following letter, addressed by Lockhart to Ford,
sufficiently explains the position:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>London</i>,<br />
<i>June</i> 13<i>th</i>, 1845.</p>
<p><i>Dear Ford</i>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>El Gitano</i>&rsquo; <i>sent me a paper on the</i>
&ldquo;<i>Hand-Book</i>&rdquo; <i>which I read with
delight</i>.&nbsp; <i>It seemed just another capital chapter of
his</i> &ldquo;<i>Bible in Spain</i>,&rdquo; <i>and I
thought</i>, <i>as there was hardly a word of</i>
&lsquo;<i>review</i>,&rsquo; <i>and no extract giving the least
notion of the peculiar merits and style of the</i>
&ldquo;<i>Hand-Book</i>,&rdquo; <i>that I could easily</i> (<i>as
is my constant custom</i>) <i>supply the humbler part myself</i>,
<i>and so present at once a fair review of the work</i>, <i>and a
lively specimen of our friend&rsquo;s vein of eloquence in
exordio</i>.</p>
<p><i>But</i>, <i>behold</i>! <i>he will not allow any
tampering</i> . . . <i>I now write to condole with you</i>;
<i>for I am very sensible</i>, <i>after all</i>, <i>that you run
a great risk in having your book committed to hands far less
competent for treating it or any other book of Spanish interest
than Borrow&rsquo;s would have been</i> . . . <i>but I consider
that</i>, <i>after all</i>, <i>in the case of a new author</i>,
<i>it is the first duty of</i> &ldquo;<i>The Quarterly
Review</i>&rdquo; <i>to introduce that author fully and fairly to
the public</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Ever Yours Truly</i>,<br />
<i>J. G. Lockhart</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>The action of Lockhart in seeking to amend his Essay
excited Borrow&rsquo;s keenest indignation, and induced him to
produce the following amusing squib:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Would it not be more dignified</i><br />
<i>To run up debts on every side</i>,<br />
<i>And then to pay your debts refuse</i>,<br />
<i>Than write for rascally Reviews</i>?<br />
<i>And lectures give to great and small</i>,<br />
<i>In pot-house</i>, <i>theatre</i>, <i>and town-hall</i>,<br />
<i>Wearing your brains by night and day</i><br />
<i>To win the means to pay your way</i>?<br />
<i>I vow by him who reigns in</i> [<i>hell</i>],<br />
<i>It would be more respectable</i>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This squib was never printed by Borrow.&nbsp; I chanced to
light upon it recently in a packet of his as yet unpublished
verse.</p>
<p>The Essay itself is far too interesting, and far too
characteristic of its author, to be permitted to remain any
longer inaccessible; hence the present reprint.&nbsp; The
original is a folio pamphlet, extending to twelve numbered
pages.&nbsp; Of this pamphlet no more than two copies would
appear to have been struck off, and both are fortunately extant
to-day.&nbsp; One of these was formerly in the possession of Dr.
William J. Knapp, and is now the property of the Hispanic Society
of New York.&nbsp; The second example is in my own library.&nbsp;
This was Borrow&rsquo;s own copy, and is freely <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>corrected in
his handwriting throughout.&nbsp; From this copy the present
edition has been printed, and in preparing it the whole of the
corrections and additions made by Borrow to the text of the
original pamphlet have been adopted.</p>
<p>A reduced facsimile of the last page of the pamphlet serves as
frontispiece to the present volume.</p>

11</span>A SUPPLEMENTARY CHAPTER TO THE BIBLE IN SPAIN</h2>
<p>Does Gibraltar, viewing the horrors which are continually
taking place in Spain, and which, notwithstanding their frequent
grotesqueness, have drawn down upon that country the indignation
of the entire civilized world, never congratulate herself on her
severance from the peninsula, for severed she is morally and
physically?&nbsp; Who knows what is passing in the bosom of the
old Rock?&nbsp; Yet on observing the menacing look which she
casts upon Spain across the neutral ground, we have thought that
provided she could speak it would be something after the
following fashion:&mdash;</p>
<p>Accursed land! I hate thee; and, far from being a defence,
will invariably prove a thorn in thy side, a source of
humiliation and ignominy, a punishment for thy sorceries, thy
abominations and idolatries&mdash;thy cruelty, thy cowardice and
miserable pride; I will <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>look on whilst thy navies are burnt
in my many bays, and thy armies perish before my eternal
walls&mdash;I will look on whilst thy revenues are defrauded and
ruined, and thy commerce becomes a bye word and a laughing-stock,
and I will exult the while and shout&mdash;&lsquo;I am an
instrument in the hand of the Lord, even I, the old volcanic
hill&mdash;I have pertained to the Moor and the Briton&mdash;they
have unfolded their banners from my heights, and I have been
content&mdash;I have belonged solely to the irrational beings of
nature, and no human hum invaded my solitudes; the eagle nestled
on my airy crags, and the tortoise and the sea-calf dreamed in my
watery caverns undisturbed; even then I was content, for I was
aloof from Spain and her sons.&nbsp; The days of my shame were
those when I was clasped in her embraces and was polluted by her
crimes; when I was a forced partaker in her bad faith,
soul-subduing tyranny, and degrading fanaticism; when I heard
only her bragging tongue, and was redolent of nought but the
breath of her smoke-loving borrachos; when I was a prison for her
convicts and a garrison for her rabble soldiery&mdash;Spain,
accursed land, I hate thee: may I, like my African neighbour,
become a house and a retreat only for vile baboons rather than
the viler Spaniard.&nbsp; May I sink beneath the billows, which
is my foretold fate, ere I become again a parcel of
Spain&mdash;accursed land, I hate thee, and so long as I can
uphold my brow will still look menacingly on Spain.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Strong language this, it will perhaps be
observed&mdash;but when the rocks speak strong language may be
expected, and it is no slight matter which will set stones
a-speaking.&nbsp; Surely, if ever there was a time for Gibraltar
to speak, it is the present, and we leave it to our readers to
determine whether the above is not a real voice from Gibraltar
heard by ourselves one moonlight night at Algeziras, as with our
hands in our pockets we stood on the pier, staring across the bay
in the direction of the rock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Spain, unfortunate Spain!&rsquo; we have
frequently heard Spaniards exclaim.&nbsp; Were it worth while
asking the Spaniard a reason for anything he says or does, we
should be tempted to ask him why he apostrophizes his country in
this manner.&nbsp; If she is wretched and miserable and bleeding,
has she anything but what she richly deserves, and has brought
down upon her own head?&nbsp; By Spain we of course mean the
Spanish nation&mdash;for as for the country, it is so much
impassible matter, so much rock and sand, chalk and
clay&mdash;with which we have for the moment nothing to do.&nbsp;
It has pleased her to play an arrant jade&rsquo;s part, the part
of a <i>mula falsa</i>, a vicious mule, and now, and not for the
first time, the brute has been chastised&mdash;there she lies on
the road amidst the dust, the blood running from her nose.&nbsp;
Did our readers ever peruse the book of the adventures of the
Squire Marcos de Obregon? <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; No!&nbsp; How
should our <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>readers have perused the scarce book
of the life and adventures of Obregon? never mind! we to whom it
has been given to hear the voice of Gibraltar whilst standing on
the pier of Algeziras one moonlight evening, with our hands in
our pockets, jingling the cuartos which they contained, have read
with considerable edification the adventures of the said Marcos,
and will tell the reader a story out of the book of his
life.&nbsp; So it came to pass that in one of his journeys the
Se&ntilde;or de Obregon found himself on the back of a mule,
which, to use his own expression, had the devil in her body, a
regular jade, which would neither allow herself to be shod or
saddled without making all the resistance in her power&mdash;was
in the habit of flinging herself down whenever she came to a
sandy place, and rolling over with her heels in the air.&nbsp; An
old muleteer, who observed her performing this last prank, took
pity on her rider, and said, &ldquo;Gentleman student, I wish to
give you a piece of advice with respect to that
animal&rdquo;&mdash;and then he gave Marcos the piece of advice,
which Marcos received with the respect due to a man of the
muleteer&rsquo;s experience, and proceeded on his way.&nbsp;
Coming to a sandy place shortly after, he felt that the mule was,
as usual, about to give way to her <i>penchant</i>, whereupon,
without saying a word to any body, he followed the advice of the
muleteer and with a halter which he held in his hand struck with
all fury the jade between the two ears.&nbsp; Down fell the mule
in the dust, and, rolling on <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>her side,
turned up the whites of her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;And as I stood by
looking at her,&rsquo; said Marcos, &lsquo;I was almost sorry
that I had struck her so hard, seeing how she turned up the
whites of her eyes.&nbsp; At length, however, I took a luncheon
of bread, and steeping it in wine from my bota, I thrust it
between her jaws, and thus revived her; and I assure you that
from that moment she never played any tricks with me, but behaved
both formally and genteelly under all circumstances, but
especially when going over sandy ground.&nbsp; I am told,
however, that as soon as I parted with her she fell into her old
pranks, refusing to be shod or saddled&mdash;rushing up against
walls and scarifying the leg of her rider, and flinging herself
down in all sandy places.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now we say, without the
slightest regard to contradiction, knowing that no one save a
Spaniard will contradict us, that Spain has invariably proved
herself just such a jade as the mule of the cavalier De Obregon:
with a kind and merciful rider what will she not do?&nbsp; Look
at her, how she refuses to be bridled or shod&mdash;how she
scarifies the poor man&rsquo;s leg against rude walls, how ill
she behaves in sandy places, and how occasionally diving her head
between her fore-legs and kicking up behind she causes him to
perform a somersault in the air to the no small discomposure of
his Spanish gravity; but let her once catch a Tartar who will
give her the garrote right well between the ears, and she can
behave as well as any body.&nbsp; One of the best of her riders
was Charles the <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>First.&nbsp; How the brute lay
floundering in the dust on the plains of Villalar, turning up the
whites of her eyes, the blood streaming thick from her dishonest
nose!&nbsp; There she lay, the Fleming staring at her, with the
garrote in his hand.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right, Fleming! give it
her again&mdash;and withhold the sopa till the very last
extremity.</p>
<p>Then there was Napoleon again, who made her taste the garrote;
she was quiet enough under him, but he soon left her and went to
ride other jades, and his place was filled by those who, though
they had no liking for her, had not vigour enough to bring her
down on her side.&nbsp; She is down, however, at present, if ever
she was in her life&mdash;blood streaming from her nose amidst
the dust, the whites of her eyes turned up very much, whilst
staring at her with uplifted garrote stands Narvaez.</p>
<p>Yes, there lies Spain, and who can pity her?&mdash;she could
kick off the kind and generous Espartero, who, though he had a
stout garrote in his hand, and knew what kind of conditioned
creature she was, forbore to strike her, to his own mighty cost
and damage.&nbsp; She kicked off him, and took up&mdash;whom? a
regular muleteer, neither more nor less.&nbsp; We have nothing
further to say about him; he is at present in his proper calling,
we bear him no ill-will, and only wish that God may speed
him.&nbsp; But never shall we forget the behaviour of the jade
some two years ago.&nbsp; O the yell that she set up, the true
mulish yell&mdash;knowing all <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the time that
she had nothing to fear from her rider, knowing that he would not
strike her between the ears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come here, you
scoundrel, and we will make a bell-clapper of your head, and of
your bowels a string to hang it by&rsquo;&mdash;that was the cry
of the Barcelonese, presently echoed in every town and village
throughout Spain&mdash;and that cry was raised immediately after
he had remitted the mulct which he had imposed on Barcelona for
unprovoked rebellion.&nbsp; But the mule is quiet enough now; no
such yell is heard now at Barcelona, or in any nook or corner of
Spain.&nbsp; No, no&mdash;the Caballero was kicked out of the
saddle, and the muleteer sprang up&mdash;There she lies, the
brute!&nbsp; <i>Bien hecho</i>, <i>Narvaez</i>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t
spare the garrote nor the mule!</p>
<p>It is very possible that from certain passages which we have
written above, some of our readers may come to the conclusion
that we must be partisans either of Espartero or Narvaez, perhaps
of both.&nbsp; In such case, however, they would do us
wrong.&nbsp; Having occasion at present to speak of Spain, we
could hardly omit taking some notice of what has been lately
going on in the country, and of the two principal performers in
the late <i>funcion</i>.&nbsp; We have not been inattentive
observers of it; and have, moreover, some knowledge of the
country; but any such feeling as partisanship we disclaim.&nbsp;
Of Narvaez, the muleteer, we repeat that we have nothing more to
say, his character is soon read.&nbsp; Of the caballero&mdash;of
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Espartero, we take this opportunity of observing that
the opinion which we at first entertained of him, grounded on
what we had heard, was anything but favourable.&nbsp; We thought
him a grasping ambitious man; and, like many others in Spain,
merely wishing for power for the lust thereof; but we were soon
undeceived by his conduct when the reins of government fell into
his hand.&nbsp; That he was ambitious we have no doubt; but his
ambition was of the noble and generous kind; he wished to become
the regenerator of his country&mdash;to heal her sores, and at
the same time to reclaim her vices&mdash;to make her really
strong and powerful&mdash;and, above all, independent of
France.&nbsp; But all his efforts were foiled by the wilfulness
of the animal&mdash;she observed his gentleness, which she
mistook for fear, a common mistake with jades&mdash;gave a kick,
and good bye to Espartero!&nbsp; There is, however, one blot in
Espartero&rsquo;s career; we allude to it with pain, for in every
other point we believe him to have been a noble and generous
character; but his treatment of Cordova cannot be commended on
any principle of honour or rectitude.&nbsp; Cordova was his
friend and benefactor, to whom he was mainly indebted for his
advancement in the army.&nbsp; Espartero was a brave soldier,
with some talent for military matters.&nbsp; But when did either
bravery or talent serve as credentials for advancement in the
Spanish service?&nbsp; He would have remained at the present day
a major or a colonel but for the friendship of Cordova, who, <!--
page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>amongst other things, was a courtier, and who was raised
to the command of the armies of Spain by a court
intrigue&mdash;which command he resigned into the hands of
Espartero when the revolution of the Granja and the downfall of
his friends, the Moderados, compelled him to take refuge in
France.&nbsp; The friendship of Cordova and Espartero had been so
well known that for a long time it was considered that the latter
was merely holding the command till his friend might deem it safe
and prudent to return and resume it.&nbsp; Espartero, however,
had conceived widely different views.&nbsp; After the return of
Cordova to Spain he caused him to be exiled under some pretence
or other.&nbsp; He doubtless feared him, and perhaps with reason;
but the man had been his friend and benefactor, and to the
relations which had once existed between them Cordova himself
alludes in a manifesto which he printed at Badajoz when on his
way to Portugal, and which contains passages of considerable
pathos.&nbsp; Is there not something like retribution in the fact
that Espartero is now himself in exile?</p>
<p>Cordova!&nbsp; His name is at present all but forgotten, yet
it was at one time in the power of that man to have made himself
master of the destinies of Spain.&nbsp; He was at the head of the
army&mdash;was the favourite of Christina&mdash;and was,
moreover, in the closest connexion with the Moderado
party&mdash;the most unscrupulous, crafty, and formidable of all
the factions which in these latter times have appeared in the
bloody circus <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>of Spain.&nbsp; But if ever there was
a man, a real man of flesh and blood, who in every tittle
answered to one of the best of the many well-drawn characters in
Le Sage&rsquo;s wonderful novel&mdash;one of the masters of Gil
Blas, a certain Don Mathias, who got up at midday, and rasped
tobacco whilst lolling on the sofa, till the time arrived for
dressing and strolling forth to the prado&mdash;a thorough
Spanish coxcomb highly perfumed, who wrote love-letters to
himself bearing the names of noble ladies&mdash;brave withal and
ever ready to vindicate his honour at the sword&rsquo;s point,
provided he was not called out too early of a morning&mdash;it
was this self-same Don Cordova, who we repeat had the destinies
of Spain at one time in his power, and who, had he managed his
cards well, and death had not intervened, might at the present
moment have occupied the self-same position which Narvaez fills
with so much credit to himself.&nbsp; The man had lots of
courage, was well versed in the art military; and once, to his
honour be it said, whilst commanding a division of the Christine
army, defeated Zumalacarregui in his own defiles; but, like Don
Mathias, he was fond of champagne suppers with actresses, and
would always postpone a battle for a ball or a horse-race.&nbsp;
About five years ago we were lying off Lisbon in a steamer in our
way from Spain.&nbsp; The morning was fine, and we were upon deck
staring vacantly about us, as is our custom, with our hands in
our pockets, when a large barge with an awning, and manned by
many <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>rowers, came dashing through the water and touched the
vessel&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Some people came on board, of whom,
however, we took but little notice, continuing with our hands in
our pockets staring sometimes at the river, and sometimes at the
castle of Saint George, the most remarkable object connected with
the &lsquo;white city,&rsquo; which strikes the eye from the
Tagus.&nbsp; In a minute or two the steward came running up to us
from the cabin, and said, &lsquo;There are two or three strange
people below who seem to want something; but what it is we
can&rsquo;t make out, for we don&rsquo;t understand them.&nbsp;
Now I heard you talking &lsquo;Moors&rsquo; the other day to the
black cook, so pray have the kindness to come and say two or
three words in Moors to the people below.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon,
without any hesitation, we followed the steward into the
cabin.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s one who can jabber Moors with
you,&rsquo; bawled he, bustling up to the new comers.&nbsp; On
observing the strangers, however, who sat on one of the sofas,
instead of addressing them in &lsquo;Moors,&rsquo; we took our
hands out of our pockets, drew ourselves up, and making a most
ceremonious bow, exclaimed in pure and sonorous Castilian,
&lsquo;Cavaliers, at your feet!&nbsp; What may it please you to
command?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The strangers, who had looked somewhat blank at the first
appearance of our figure, no sooner heard us address them in this
manner than they uttered a simultaneous &lsquo;Ola!&rsquo; and,
springing up, advanced towards us with countenances irradiated
with smiles.&nbsp; <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>They were three in number, to say
nothing of a tall loutish fellow with something of the look of a
domestic, who stood at some distance.&nbsp; All three were
evidently gentlemen&mdash;one was a lad about twenty, the other
might be some ten years older&mdash;but the one who stood between
the two, and who immediately confronted us, was evidently the
principal.&nbsp; He might be about forty, and was tall and rather
thin; his hair was of the darkest brown; his face strongly marked
and exceedingly expressive; his nose was fine, so was his
forehead, and his eyes sparkled like diamonds beneath a pair of
bushy brows slightly grizzled.&nbsp; He had one disagreeable
feature&mdash;his mouth&mdash;which was wide and sensual-looking
to a high degree.&nbsp; He was dressed with elegance&mdash;his
brown surtout was faultless; shirt of the finest Holland, frill
to correspond, and fine ruby pin.&nbsp; In a very delicate and
white hand he held a delicate white handkerchief perfumed with
the best atar-de-nuar of Abderrahman.&nbsp; &lsquo;What can we
oblige you in, cavalier?&rsquo; said we, as we looked him in the
face: and then he took our hand, our brown hand, into his
delicate white one, and whispered something into our
ear&mdash;whereupon, turning round to the steward, we whispered
something into his ear.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know nothing about
it,&rsquo; said the steward in a surly tone&mdash;we have nothing
of the kind on board&mdash;no such article or packet is come; and
I tell you what, I don&rsquo;t half like these fellows; I believe
them to be custom-house spies: it was the custom-house barge <!--
page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>they came in, so tell them in Moors to get about their
business.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The man is a barbarian, sir,&rsquo;
said we to the cavalier; &lsquo;but what you expected is
certainly not come.&rsquo;&nbsp; A deep shade of melancholy came
over the countenance of the cavalier: he looked us wistfully in
the face, and sighed; then, turning to his companions, he said,
&lsquo;We are disappointed, but there is no remedy&mdash;Vamos,
amigos.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, making us a low bow, he left the
cabin, followed by his friends.&nbsp; The boat was ready, and the
cavalier was about to descend the side of the vessel&mdash;we had
also come on deck&mdash;suddenly our eyes met.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pardon a stranger, cavalier, if he takes the liberty of
asking your illustrious name.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;General
Cordova,&rsquo; said the cavalier in an under voice.&nbsp; We
made our lowest bow, pressed our hand to our heart&mdash;he did
the same, and in another minute was on his way to the
shore.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know who that was?&rsquo; said we to
the steward&mdash;&lsquo;that was the great General
Cordova.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Cordova, Cordova,&rsquo; said the
steward.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I really believe I have something for
that name.&nbsp; A general do you say?&nbsp; What a fool I have
been&mdash;I suppose you couldn&rsquo;t call him
back?&rsquo;&nbsp; The next moment we were at the ship&rsquo;s
side shouting.&nbsp; The boat had by this time nearly reached the
Caesodrea, though, had it reached Cintra&mdash;but stay, Cintra
is six leagues from Lisbon&mdash;and, moreover, no boat unless
carried can reach Cintra.&nbsp; Twice did we lift up our
voice.&nbsp; At the second shout the boat rested on its oars; and
when we added &lsquo;Caballeros, <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>vengan
ustedes atras,&rsquo; its head was turned round in a jiffy, and
back it came bounding over the waters with twice its former
rapidity.&nbsp; We are again in the cabin; the three Spaniards,
the domestic, ourselves, and the steward; the latter stands with
his back against the door, for the purpose of keeping out
intruders.&nbsp; There is a small chest on the table, on which
all eyes are fixed; and now, at a sign from Cordova, the domestic
advances, in his hand a chisel, which he inserts beneath the lid
of the chest, exerting all the strength of his wrist&mdash;the
lid flies open, and discloses some hundreds of genuine Havannah
cigars.&nbsp; &lsquo;What obligations am I not under to
you!&rsquo; said Cordova, again taking us by the hand, &lsquo;the
very sight of them gives me new life; long have I been expecting
them.&nbsp; A trusty friend at Gibraltar promised to send them,
but they have tarried many weeks: but now to dispose of this
treasure.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a moment he and his friends were busily
employed in filling their pockets.&nbsp; Yes Cordova, the
renowned general, and the two secretaries of a certain legation
at Lisbon&mdash;for such were his two friends&mdash;are stowing
away the Havannah cigars with all the eagerness of
contrabandistas.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rascal,&rsquo; said Cordova,
suddenly turning to his domestic with a furious air and regular
Spanish grimace, &lsquo;you are doing nothing; why don&rsquo;t
you take more?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t hold any more,
your worship,&rsquo; replied the latter in a piteous tone.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My pockets are already full; and see how full I am
here,&rsquo; he continued, <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>pointing to
his bosom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Peace, bribon,&rsquo; said his master;
&lsquo;if your bosom is full, fill your hat, and put it on your
head.&nbsp; We owe you more than we can express,&rsquo; said he,
turning round and addressing us in the blandest tones.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But why all this mystery?&rsquo; we demanded.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O, tobacco is a royal monopoly here, you know, so we are
obliged to be cautious.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But you came in the
custom-house barge?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, the superintendent
of the customs lent it to us in order that we might be put to as
little inconvenience as possible.&nbsp; Between ourselves, he
knows all about it; he is only solicitous to avoid any
scandal.&nbsp; Really these Portuguese have some slight tincture
of gentility in them, though they are neither Castilian nor
English,&rsquo; he continued, making us another low bow.&nbsp; On
taking his departure the general gave the steward an ounce of
gold, and having embraced us and kissed us on the cheek, said,
&lsquo;In a few weeks I shall be in England, pray come and see me
there.&rsquo;&nbsp; This we promised faithfully to do, but never
had the opportunity; he went on shore with his cigars, gave a
champagne supper to his friends, and the next morning was a
corpse.&nbsp; What a puff of smoke is the breath of man!</p>
<p>But here before us is a Hand-book for Spain.&nbsp; From what
we have written above it will have been seen that we are not
altogether unacquainted with the country; indeed we plead guilty
to having performed the grand tour of Spain more than once; but
why do we say guilty&mdash;it is scarcely a thing to be ashamed
of; <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>the country is a magnificent one, and the people are a
highly curious people, and we are by no means sorry that we have
made the acquaintance of either.&nbsp; Detestation of the public
policy of Spain, and a hearty abhorrence of its state creed, we
consider by no means incompatible with a warm admiration for the
natural beauties of the country, and even a zest for Spanish life
and manners.&nbsp; We love a ride in Spain, and the company to be
found in a Spanish venta; but the Lord preserve us from the
politics of Spain, and from having anything to do with the
Spaniards in any graver matters than interchanging cigars and
compliments, meetings upon the road (peaceable ones of course),
kissing and embracing (see above).&nbsp; Whosoever wishes to
enjoy Spain or the Spaniards, let him go as a private individual,
the humbler in appearance the better: let him call every beggar
Cavalier, every Don a Se&ntilde;or Conde; praise the water of the
place in which he happens to be as the best of all water; and
wherever he goes he will meet with attention and sympathy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The strange Cavalier is evidently the child of honourable
fathers, although, poor man, he appears to be, like myself,
unfortunate&rsquo;&mdash;will be the ejaculation of many a proud
<i>tatterdemalion</i> who has been refused charity with formal
politeness&mdash;whereas should the stranger chuck him
contemptuously an ounce of gold, he may be pretty sure that he
has bought his undying hatred both in this world and the
next.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>Here we have a Hand-book for Spain&mdash;we mean for
travellers in Spain&mdash;and of course for English
travellers.&nbsp; The various hand-books which our friend Mr.
Murray has published at different times are very well known, and
their merit generally recognized.&nbsp; We cannot say that we
have made use of any of them ourselves, yet in the course of our
peregrinations we have frequently heard travellers speak in terms
of high encomium of their general truth and exactness, and of the
immense mass of information which they contain.&nbsp; There is
one class of people, however, who are by no means disposed to
look upon these publications with a favourable eye&mdash;we mean
certain gentry generally known by the name of <i>valets de
place</i>, for whom we confess we entertain no particular
affection, believing them upon the whole to be about the most
worthless, heartless, and greedy set of miscreants to be found
upon the whole wide continent of Europe.&nbsp; These gentry, we
have reason to know, look with a by no means favourable eye upon
these far-famed publications of Albemarle-street.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They steal away our honest bread,&rsquo; said one of them
to us the other day at Venice, &lsquo;<i>I Signori forestieri</i>
find no farther necessity for us since they have appeared; we are
thinking of petitioning the government in order that they may be
prohibited as heretical and republican.&nbsp; Were it not for
these accursed books I should now have the advantage of waiting
upon those <i>forestieri</i>&rsquo;&mdash;and he pointed to a fat
English squire, who with a <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>blooming
daughter under each arm, was proceeding across the piazza to St.
Marco with no other guide than a &lsquo;Murray,&rsquo; which he
held in his hand.&nbsp; High, however, as was the opinion which
we had formed of these Hand-books from what we had heard
concerning them, we were utterly unprepared for such a treat as
has been afforded us by the perusal of the one which now lies
before us&mdash;the Hand-book for Spain.</p>
<p>It is evidently the production of a highly-gifted and
accomplished man of infinite cleverness, considerable learning,
and who is moreover thoroughly acquainted with the subject of
which he treats.&nbsp; That he knows Spain as completely as he
knows the lines upon the palm of his hand, is a fact which cannot
fail of forcing itself upon the conviction of any person who
shall merely glance over the pages; yet this is a book not to be
glanced over, for we defy any one to take it up without being
seized with an irresistible inclination to peruse it from the
beginning to the end&mdash;so flowing and captivating is the
style, and so singular and various are the objects and events
here treated of.&nbsp; We have here a perfect panorama of Spain,
to accomplish which we believe to have been the aim and intention
of the author; and gigantic as the conception was, it is but
doing him justice to say that in our opinion he has fully worked
it out.&nbsp; But what iron application was required for the
task&mdash;what years of enormous labour must have been spent in
carrying it into effect even after the necessary materials had
been collected&mdash;and then the <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>collecting of
the materials themselves&mdash;what strange ideas of difficulty
and danger arise in our minds at the sole mention of that most
important point!&nbsp; But here is the work before us; the
splendid result of the toil, travel, genius, and learning of one
man, and that man an Englishman.&nbsp; The above is no
overstrained panegyric; we refer our readers to the work itself,
and then fearlessly abandon the matter to their decision.&nbsp;
We have here all Spain before us; mountain, plain, and river,
<i>poblado y desploblado</i>&mdash;the well known and the
mysterious&mdash;Barcelona and Batuecas.</p>
<p>Amidst all the delight and wonder which we have felt, we
confess that we have been troubled by an impertinent thought of
which we could not divest ourselves.&nbsp; We could not help
thinking that the author, generous enough as he has been to the
public, has been rather unjust to himself&mdash;by publishing the
result of his labours under the present title.&nbsp; A Hand-book
is a Hand-book after all, a very useful thing, but
still&mdash;The fact is that we live in an age of humbug, in
which every thing to obtain much note and reputation must depend
less upon its own intrinsic merits than on the name it
bears.&nbsp; The present work is about one of the best books ever
written upon Spain; but we are afraid that it will never be
estimated at its proper value; for after all a Hand-book is a
Hand-book.&nbsp; Permit us, your Ladyship, to introduce to you
the learned, talented, and imaginative author of
the&mdash;shocking!&nbsp; Her Ladyship would faint, and would
<!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>never again admit ourselves and our friends to her
<i>soir&eacute;es</i>.&nbsp; What a pity that this delightful
book does not bear a more romantic sounding
title&mdash;&rsquo;Wanderings in Spain,&rsquo; for example; or
yet better, &lsquo;The Wonders of the Peninsula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But are we not ourselves doing our author injustice?&nbsp; Aye
surely; the man who could write a book of the character of the
one which we have at present under notice, is above all such
paltry considerations, so we may keep our pity for
ourselves.&nbsp; If it please him to cast his book upon the
waters in the present shape, what have we to do but to be
grateful?&mdash;we forgot for a moment with what description of
man we have to do.&nbsp; This is no vain empty coxcomb; he cannot
but be aware that he has accomplished a great task; but such
paltry considerations as those to which we have alluded above are
not for him but for writers of a widely different stamp with whom
we have nothing to do.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">What to observe in Spain</span>.</h3>
<p>Before we proceed to point out the objects best worth seeing
in the Peninsula, many of which are to be seen there only, it may
be as well to mention what is <i>not</i> to be seen: there is no
such loss of time as finding this out oneself, after weary chace
and wasted hour.&nbsp; Those who expect to find well-garnished
arsenals, libraries, restaurants, charitable or literary
institutions, canals, railroads, tunnels, suspension-bridges,
<!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>steam-engines, omnibuses, manufactories, polytechnic
galleries, pale-ale breweries, and similar appliances and
appurtenances of a high state of political, social, and
commercial civilisation, had better stay at home.&nbsp; In Spain
there are no turnpike-trust meetings, no quarter-sessions, no
courts of <i>justice</i>, according to the real meaning of that
word, no treadmills, no boards of guardians, no chairmen,
directors, masters-extraordinary of the court of chancery, no
assistant poor-law commissioners.&nbsp; There are no
anti-tobacco-teetotal-temperance meetings, no auxiliary
missionary propagating societies, nothing in the blanket and
lying-in asylum line, nothing, in short, worth a revising
barrister of three years&rsquo; standing&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp;
Spain is no country for the political economist, beyond affording
an example of the decline of the wealth of nations, and offering
a wide topic on errors to be avoided, as well as for experimental
theories, plans of reform and amelioration.&nbsp; In Spain,
Nature reigns; she has there lavished her utmost prodigality of
soil and climate which a bad government has for the last three
centuries been endeavouring to counteract.&nbsp; <i>El cielo y
suelo es bueno</i>, <i>el entresuelo malo</i>, and man, the
occupier of the Peninsula <i>entresol</i>, uses, or rather
abuses, with incurious apathy the goods with which the gods have
provided him.&nbsp; Spain is a <i>terra incognita</i> to
naturalists, geologists, and every branch of ists and
ologists.&nbsp; The material is as superabundant as native
labourers and operatives are deficient.&nbsp; All <!-- page
32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>these
interesting branches of inquiry, healthful and agreeable, as
being out-of-door pursuits, and bringing the amateur in close
contact with nature, offer to embryo authors, who are ambitious
to <i>book something new</i>, a more worthy subject than the
<i>decies repetita</i> descriptions of bull-fights and the
natural history of ollas and ventas.&nbsp; Those who aspire to
the romantic, the poetical, the sentimental, the artistical, the
antiquarian, the classical, in short, to any of the sublime and
beautiful lines, will find both in the past and present state of
Spain subjects enough, in wandering with lead-pencil and
note-book through this singular country, which hovers between
Europe and Africa, between civilisation and barbarism; this is
the land of the green valley and barren mountain, of the
boundless plain and the broken sierra, now of Elysian gardens of
the vine, the olive, the orange, and the aloe, then of trackless,
vast, silent, uncultivated wastes, the heritage of the wild
bee.&nbsp; Here we fly from the dull uniformity, the polished
monotony of Europe, to the racy freshness of an original,
unchanged country, where antiquity treads on the heels of to-day,
where Paganism disputes the very altar with Christianity, where
indulgence and luxury contend with privation and poverty, where a
want of all that is generous or merciful is blended with the most
devoted heroic virtues, where the most cold-blooded cruelty is
linked with the fiery passions of Africa, where ignorance and
erudition stand in violent and striking contrast.</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>Here let the antiquarian pore over the stirring
memorials of many thousand years, the vestiges of Ph&oelig;nician
enterprise, of Roman magnificence, of Moorish elegance, in that
storehouse of ancient customs, that repository of all elsewhere
long forgotten and passed by; here let him gaze upon those
classical monuments, unequalled almost in Greece or Italy, and on
those fairy Aladdin palaces, the creatures of Oriental
gorgeousness and imagination, with which Spain alone can enchant
the dull European; here let the man of feeling dwell on the
poetry of her envy-disarming decay, fallen from her high estate,
the dignity of a dethroned monarch, borne with unrepining
self-respect, the last consolation of the innately noble, which
no adversity can take away; here let the lover of art feed his
eyes with the mighty masterpieces of Italian art, when Raphael
and Titian strove to decorate the palaces of Charles, the great
emperor of the age of Leo X., or with the living nature of
Velazquez and Murillo, whose paintings are truly to be seen in
Spain alone; here let the artist sketch the lowly mosque of the
Moor, the lofty cathedral of the Christian, in which God is
worshipped in a manner as nearly befitting His glory as the power
and wealth of finite man can reach; art and nature here offer
subjects, from the feudal castle, the vasty Escorial, the
rock-built alcazar of imperial Toledo, the sunny towers of
stately Seville, to the eternal snows and lovely vega of Granada:
let the geologist clamber <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>over
mountains of marble, and metal-pregnant sierras, let the botanist
cull from the wild hothouse of nature plants unknown, unnumbered,
matchless in colour, and breathing the aroma of the sweet south;
let all, learned or unlearned, listen to the song, the guitar,
the Castanet; let all mingle with the gay, good-humoured,
temperate peasantry, the finest in the world, free, manly, and
independent, yet courteous and respectful; let all live with the
noble, dignified, high-bred, self-respecting Spaniard; let all
share in their easy, courteous society; let all admire their
dark-eyed women, so frank and natural, to whom the voice of all
ages and nations has conceded the palm of attraction, to whom
Venus has bequeathed her magic girdle of grace and fascination;
let all&mdash;<i>sed ohe</i>! <i>jam satis</i>&mdash;enough for
starting on this expedition, where, as Don Quixote said, there
are opportunities for what are called adventures elbow deep.</p>
<p>The following account of the rivers of Spain would do credit
to the pen of Robertson:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There are six great rivers in
Spain,&mdash;the arteries which run between the seven mountain
chains, the vertebras of the geological skeleton.&nbsp; These six
watersheds are each intersected in their extent by others on a
minor scale, by valleys and indentations, in each of which runs
its own stream.&nbsp; Thus the rains and melted snows are all
collected in an infinity of ramifications, and carried by these
tributary conduits into one of the six main trunks, or great
rivers: all these, <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>with the exception of the Ebro, empty
themselves into the Atlantic.&nbsp; The Duero and Tagus,
unfortunately for Spain, disembogue in Portugal, thus becoming a
portion of a foreign dominion exactly where their commercial
importance is the greatest.&nbsp; Philip II. saw the true value
of the possession of Portugal, which rounded and consolidated
Spain, and insured to her the possession of these valuable
outlets of internal produce, and inlets for external
commerce.&nbsp; Portugal annexed to Spain gave more real power to
his throne than the dominion of entire continents across the
Atlantic.&nbsp; The <i>Mi&ntilde;o</i>, which is the shortest of
these rivers, runs through a bosom of fertility.&nbsp; The
<i>Tajo</i>, Tagus, which the fancy of poets has sanded with gold
and embanked with roses, tracks much of its dreary way through
rocks and comparative barrenness.&nbsp; The <i>Guadiana</i>
creeps through lonely Estremadura, infecting the low plains with
miasma.&nbsp; The <i>Guadalquivir</i> eats out its deep banks
amid the sunny olive-clad regions of Andalucia, as the Ebro
divides the levels of Arragon.&nbsp; Spain abounds with brackish
streams, <i>Salados</i>, and with salt-mines, or saline deposits,
after the evaporation of the sea-waters.&nbsp; The central soil
is strongly impregnated with saltpetre: always arid, it every day
is becoming more so, from the singular antipathy which the
inhabitants of the interior have against trees.&nbsp; There is
nothing to check the power of evaporation, no shelter to protect
or preserve moisture.&nbsp; The soil becomes more <!-- page
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>and
more baked and calcined; in some parts it has almost ceased to be
available for cultivation: another serious evil, which arises
from want of plantations, is, that the slopes of hills are
everywhere liable to constant denudation of soil after heavy
rain.&nbsp; There is nothing to break the descent of the water;
hence the naked, barren stone summits of many of the sierras,
which have been pared and peeled of every particle capable of
nourishing vegetation; they are skeletons where life is
extinct.&nbsp; Not only is the soil thus lost, but the detritus
washed down either forms bars at the mouths of rivers, or chokes
up and raises their beds; they are thus rendered liable to
overflow their banks, and convert the adjoining plains into
pestilential swamps.&nbsp; The supply of water, which is afforded
by periodical rains, and which ought to support the reservoirs of
rivers, is carried off at once in violent floods, rather than in
a gentle gradual disembocation.&nbsp; The volume in the principal
rivers of Spain has diminished, and is diminishing.&nbsp; Rivers
which were navigable are so no longer; the artificial canals
which were to have been substituted remain unfinished: the
progress of deterioration advances, while little is done to
counteract or amend what every year must render more difficult
and expensive, while the means of repair and correction will
diminish in equal proportion, from the poverty occasioned by the
evil, and by the fearful extent which it will be allowed to
attain.&nbsp; The rivers which are really adapted to <!-- page
37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>navigation are, however, only those which are
perpetually fed by those tributary streams that flow down from
mountains which are covered with snow all the year, and these are
not many.&nbsp; The majority of Spanish rivers are very scanty of
water during the summer time, and very rapid in their flow when
filled by rains or melting snow: during these periods they are
impracticable for boats.&nbsp; They are, moreover, much exhausted
by being drained off, bled, for the purposes of artificial
irrigation.&nbsp; The scarcity of rain in the central table-lands
is much against a regular supply of water to the springs of the
rivers: the water is soon sucked up by a parched, dusty, and
thirsty soil, or evaporated by the dryness of the
atmosphere.&nbsp; Many of the <i>sierras</i> are indeed covered
with snow, but to no great depth, and the coating soon melts
under the summer suns, and passes rapidly away.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have a sunny little sketch of a certain locality at
Seville; it is too life-like not to have been taken on the
spot:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The sunny flats under the old Moorish
walls, which extend between the gates of <i>Carmona</i> and <i>La
Carne</i>, are the haunts of idlers and of gamesters.&nbsp; The
lower classes of Spaniards are constantly gambling at cards:
groups are to be seen playing all day long for wine, love, or
coppers, in the sun, or under their vine-trellises.&nbsp; There
is generally some well-known cock of the walk, a bully, or
<i>guapo</i>, who will come up and lay his hands on the cards,
and say, &lsquo;No one shall play <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>here but with
mine&rsquo;&mdash;<i>aqu&iacute; no se juega sino con mis
barajas</i>.&nbsp; If the gamblers are cowed, they give him
<i>dos cuartos</i>, a halfpenny each.&nbsp; If, however, one of
the challenged be a spirited fellow, he defies him.&nbsp;
<i>Aqu&iacute; no se cobra el barato sino con un punal de
Albacete</i>&mdash;&lsquo;You get no change here except out of an
Albacete knife.&rsquo;&nbsp; If the defiance be accepted,
<i>vamos alla</i> is the answer&mdash;&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go to
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s an end then of the cards, all
flock to the more interesting <i>&eacute;cart&eacute;</i>;
instances have occurred, where Greek meets Greek, of their tying
the two advanced feet together, and yet remaining fencing with
knife and cloak for a quarter of an hour before the blow be
dealt.&nbsp; The knife is held firmly, the thumb is pressed
straight on the blade, and calculated either for the cut or
thrust, to chip bread and kill men.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apropos of Seville.&nbsp; It is sometimes called we believe La
Capital de Majeza; the proper translation of which we conceive to
be the Head Quarters of Foolery, for nothing more absurd and
contemptible than this Majeza ever came within the sphere of our
contemplation.&nbsp; Nevertheless it constitutes the chief glory
of the Sevillians.&nbsp; Every Sevillian, male or female, rich or
poor, handsome or ugly, aspires at a certain period of life to
the character of the majo or maja.&nbsp; We are not going to
waste either space or time by entering into any lengthened detail
of this ridiculous nonsense: indeed, it is quite unnecessary;
almost every one of the books published on Spain, <!-- page
39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>and
their name at present is legion, being crammed with details of
this same Majeza&mdash;a happy combination of insolence,
ignorance, frippery, and folly.&nbsp; The majo or Tomfool struts
about the streets dressed something like a merry Andrew with
jerkin and tight hose, a faja or girdle of crimson silk round his
waist, in which is sometimes stuck a dagger, his neck exposed,
and a queer kind of half-peaked hat on his head.&nbsp; He smokes
continually, thinks there is no place like Seville, and that he
is the prettiest fellow in Seville.&nbsp; His favourite word is
&lsquo;Carajo!&rsquo;&nbsp; The maja or she-simpleton, wears a
fan and mantilla, exhibits a swimming and affected gait, thinks
that there&rsquo;s no place like Seville, that she is the flower
of Seville&mdash;Carai! is her favourite exclamation.&nbsp; But
enough of these poor ridiculous creatures.&nbsp; Yet, ridiculous
in every respect as they are, these majos and majas find
imitators and admirers in people who might be expected to look
down with contempt upon them and their follies; we have seen, and
we tell it with shame, we have seen Englishmen dressed in
Tomfool&rsquo;s livery lounging about Seville breathing out smoke
and affecting the airs of hijos de Sevilla; and what was yet
worse, fair blooming Englishwomen, forgetful of their rank as
daughters of England, appearing &agrave; la maja on the banks of
the Guadalquivir, with fan and mantilla, carai and caramba.&nbsp;
We wish sincerely that our countrymen and women whilst travelling
abroad would always bear in mind that they <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>can only be
respected or respectable so long as they maintain their proper
character&mdash;that of Englishmen and Englishwomen;&mdash;but in
attempting to appear French, Italians, and Spaniards, they only
make themselves supremely ridiculous.&nbsp; As the tree falls, so
must it lie.&nbsp; They are children of England; they cannot
alter that fact, therefore let them make the most of it, and
after all it is no bad thing to be a child of England.&nbsp; But
what a poor feeble mind must be his who would deny his country
under any circumstances!&nbsp; Therefore, gentle English
travellers, when you go to Seville, amongst other places, appear
there as English, though not obtrusively, and do not disgrace
your country by imitating the airs and graces of creatures whom
the other Spaniards, namely, Castilians, Manchegans, Aragonese,
&amp;c., pronounce to be fools.</p>
<h3>THE NORMANS IN SPAIN.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;In the ninth century, the Normans or
Northmen made piratical excursions on the W. coast of
Spain.&nbsp; They passed, in 843, from Lisbon up to the straits
and everywhere, as in France, overcame the unprepared natives,
plundering, burning, and destroying.&nbsp; They captured even
Seville itself, September 30, 844, but were met by the Cordovese
Kalif, beaten, and expelled.&nbsp; They were called by the Moors
<i>Majus</i>, <i>Madjous</i>, <i>Magioges</i> (Conde, i. 282),
and by the early Spanish annalists <i>Almajuzes</i>.&nbsp; The
root has been <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>erroneously derived from
&Mu;&iota;y&omicron;&sigmaf;, Magus, magicians or supernatural
beings, as they were almost held to be.&nbsp; The term
<i>Madjous</i> was, strictly speaking, applied by the Moors to
those Berbers and Africans who were Pagans or Muwallads,
<i>i.e.</i> not believers in the Khoran.&nbsp; The true etymology
is that of the Gog and Magog so frequently mentioned by Ezekiel
(xxxviii. and xxxix.) and in the Revelations (xx. 8) as ravagers
of the earth and nations, May-Gogg, &ldquo;he that
dissolveth,&rdquo;&mdash;the fierce Normans appeared, coming no
one knew from whence, just when the minds of men were trembling
at the approach of the millennium, and thus were held to be the
forerunners of the destroyers of the world.&nbsp; This name of
indefinite gigantic power survived in the <i>Mogigangas</i>, or
terrific images, which the Spaniards used to parade in their
religious festivals, like the Gogs and Magogs of our civic wise
men of the East.&nbsp; Thus Andalucia being the half-way point
between the N. and S.E., became the meeting-place of the two
great ravaging swarms which have desolated Europe: here the
stalwart children of frozen Norway, the worshippers of Odin,
clashed against the Saracens from torrid Arabia, the followers of
Mahomet.&nbsp; Nor can a greater proof be adduced of the power
and relative superiority of the Cordovese Moors over the other
nations of Europe, than this, their successful resistance to
those fierce invaders, who overran without difficulty the coasts
of England, France, Apulia, and Sicily: conquerors everywhere
<!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>else, here they were driven back in disgrace.&nbsp;
Hence the bitter hatred of the Normans against the Spanish Moors,
hence their alliances with the Catalans, where a Norman
impression yet remains in architecture; but, as in Sicily, these
barbarians, unrecruited from the North, soon died away, or were
assimilated as usual with the more polished people, whom they had
subdued by mere superiority of brute force.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the Moors called the Norsemen Al Madjus, which according to
our author signifies Gog and Magog, the Norsemen retorted by a
far more definite and expressive nickname; this was Blue-skins or
Bluemen, doubtless in allusion to the livid countenances of the
Moors.&nbsp; The battles between the Moors and the Northmen are
frequently mentioned in the Sagas, none of which, however, are of
higher antiquity than the eleventh century.&nbsp; In none of
these chronicles do we find any account of this raid upon Seville
in 844; it was probably a very inconsiderable affair magnified by
the Moors and their historians.&nbsp; Snorre speaks of the
terrible attack of Sigurd, surnamed the Jorsal wanderer, or
Jerusalem pilgrim, upon Lisbon and Cintra, both of which places
he took, destroying the Moors by hundreds.&nbsp; He subsequently
&lsquo;harried&rsquo; the southern coasts of Spain on his voyage
to Constantinople.&nbsp; But this occurred some two hundred years
after the affair of Seville mentioned in the Handbook.&nbsp; It
does not appear that the Norse ever made any serious attempt to
<!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>establish their power in Spain; had they done so we have
no doubt that they would have succeeded.&nbsp; We entertain all
due respect for the courage and chivalry of the Moors, especially
those of Cordova, but we would have backed the Norse, especially
the pagan Norse, against the best of them.&nbsp; The Biarkemal
would soon have drowned the Moorish &lsquo;Lelhies.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Thou Har, who grip&rsquo;st thy foeman<br
/>
Right hard, and Rolf the bowman,<br />
And many, many others,<br />
The forky lightning&rsquo;s brothers,<br />
Wake&mdash;not for banquet table,<br />
Wake&mdash;not with maids to gabble,<br />
But wake for rougher sporting,<br />
For Hildur&rsquo;s bloody courting.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the head of La Mancha our author has much to say on the
subject of Don Quixote; and to the greater part of what he says
we yield our respectful assent.&nbsp; His observations upon the
two principal characters in that remarkable work display much
sound as well as original criticism.&nbsp; We cannot however
agree with him in preferring the second part, which we think a
considerable falling off from the first.&nbsp; We should scarcely
believe the two parts were written by the same hand.&nbsp; We
have read through both various times, but we have always sighed
on coming to the conclusion of the first.&nbsp; It was formerly
our custom to read the Don &lsquo;pervasively&rsquo; once every
<!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>three years; we still keep up that custom <i>in
part</i>, and hope to do so whilst life remains.&nbsp; We say
<i>in part</i>, because we now conclude with the first part going
no farther.&nbsp; We have little sympathy with the pranks played
off upon Sancho and his master by the Duke and Duchess, to the
description of which so much space is devoted; and as for the
affair of Sancho&rsquo;s government at Barataria, it appears to
us full of inconsistency and absurdity.&nbsp; Barataria, we are
told, was a place upon the Duke&rsquo;s estate, consisting of two
or three thousand inhabitants; and of such a place it was very
possible for a nobleman to have made the poor squire governor;
but we no sooner get to Barataria than we find ourselves not in a
townlet, but in a <i>capital</i> in Madrid.&nbsp; The governor at
night makes his rounds, attended by &lsquo;an immense
watch;&rsquo; he wanders from one street to another for hours; he
encounters all kinds of adventures, not mock but real adventures,
and all kinds of characters, not mock but real characters; there
is talk of bull-circuses, theatres, gambling-houses, and such
like; and all this in a place of two or three thousand
inhabitants, in which, by the way, nothing but a cat is ever
heard stirring after eight o&rsquo;clock; this we consider to be
carrying the joke rather too far; and it is not Sancho but the
reader who is joked with.&nbsp; But the first part is a widely
different affair: all the scenes are admirable.&nbsp; Should we
live a thousand years, we should never forget the impression made
upon us by the adventure <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>of the
corpse, where the Don falls upon the priests who are escorting
the bier by torch light, and by the sequel thereto, his midnight
adventures in the Brown Mountain.&nbsp; We can only speak of
these scenes as astonishing&mdash;they have never been equalled
in their line.&nbsp; There is another wonderful book which
describes what we may call the city life of Spain, as the other
describes the vida del campo&mdash;we allude of course to Le
Sage&rsquo;s novel, which as a whole we prefer to Don Quixote,
the characters introduced being certainly more true to nature
than those which appear in the other great work.&nbsp; Shame to
Spain that she has not long since erected a statue to Le Sage,
who has done so much to illustrate her; but miserable envy and
jealousy have been at the bottom of the feeling ever manifested
in Spain towards that illustrious name.&nbsp; There are some few
stains in the grand work of Le Sage.&nbsp; He has imitated
without acknowledgment three or four passages contained in the
life of Obregon, a curious work, of which we have already spoken,
and to which on some future occasion we may perhaps revert.</p>
<p>But the Hand-book?&nbsp; We take leave of it with the highest
respect and admiration for the author; and recommend it not only
to travellers in Spain, but to the public in general, as a work
of a very high order, written <i>con amore</i> by a man who has
devoted his whole time, talents, and all the various treasures of
an extensive learning to its execution.&nbsp; We repeat that <!--
page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>we were totally unprepared for such a literary treat as
he has here placed before us.&nbsp; It is our sincere wish that
at his full convenience he will favour us with something which
may claim consanguinity with the present work.&nbsp; It hardly
becomes us to point out to an author subjects on which to
exercise his powers.&nbsp; We shall, however, take the liberty of
hinting that a good history of Spain does not exist, at least in
English&mdash;and that not even Shelton produced a satisfactory
translation of the great gem of Spanish literature, &lsquo;The
Life and Adventures of Don Quixote.&rsquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
